This code only works with bit maps with a bit depth of 24

you need to pur the image in the same folder as as the code and the config file

in the config file you need to put the file name next to the line that is in the form image#:
include the .bmp in the name

for image_index: #, put the number of images you want to be counted - 1
ex you want 10 images put 9, you want 1 image put 0

If you want a sorted (sorted by saturation) image to more easily see what the area % looks like, write 'True' next to Output sorted Image:

the file this code will create will be in the form of:

Image_1.bmp

circles: #
non-circles: #
%circles: #%
%non-circles: #%
circles%holes: #%
non-circles%holes: #%

Image_2.bmp
